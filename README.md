# Epilepsy-Detection
This project focuses on predicting epilepsy seizures using deep learning models.
  
  # Data Loading and Preprocessing:
    Loading EEG data from Google Drive.
    Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
  # Model Architecture:
    Building a Sequential LSTM Model using Keras and TensorFlow.
    Incorporating Dense Layers to optimize predictions.
  # Model Training and Evaluation:
    Training the LSTM model on time-series EEG data.
    Evaluating model performance using appropriate metrics.
